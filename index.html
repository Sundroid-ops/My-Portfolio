                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hello, I'm Lipun Dani, a first-year bachelor's student.
                    Even though I want to work as a software engineer, I'm interested in learning more about other aspects of computer science, particularly web development.                    
                </p>

                <h3>What Motivated Me To Jump Into Techchnolgy</h3>
                <p>I constantly toyed with the html codes on the internet, creating bots, and people showing off their projects when I was a teenager, so I knew straight away that I had to chose technology. I wanted to do that to share my knowledge with people and learn from them.                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="Now">
                <h3>What Am I Doing Now</h3>
                <p>I've started studying about web development and am currently applying and learning frontend stuff. I'm primarily a back-end enthusiast, but I find frontend fairly interesting, so I'm working hard to produce something worthwhile.

                <h3>My Skills</h3>
                <p>Although I believe I have sufficient front-end skills for a begineer, I still make an effort to create additional designs and varied layouts to improve the appearance. But going forward, I'll pay more attention to backend-related technology.
